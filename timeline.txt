As of May 23rd:

>
got all 3 generators to work for wave 1
file header generator
things to add:
writing data names to file 
in wave 2 or 3 add sex field 

>
some idea notes to add
versions of the file should be accessible for the user:
bank data 
social media 
general information
user ip address port numbers to create a nice port scanner
different types would be really cool to add
may add loop for the guys names module so you can spit out more than one name
try to get wave 1 done by May 30th


May 24th
May want to rethink this fake data thing and
just add faker integration for creating a csv file for ue

also going to add some name things to names module:
Names for England
also nameMains for generating multiple names for
first name
Last name
Both

May 24th
Faker python already has a lot of the ideas listed so we can skip and go to create
the school faker project this should not be too bade since create a bunch before
GPA generator should be nicer and not as harsh
GPA-->
  A student
  B student
  C student 
  D student and below
  should generate a GPA in these given ranges

may need to web scrape for courses for each university to get the info needed
Build a student with:
> course hours per semester
> year
> undergradute, graduate, post-graduate
> type of degree associate, bachelor, etc
> 

as of May 24th 20:40
>created a everything listed above except course hours, undergradaute, degree type
>add other things then start testing with pytest
>put on github then publish to pyPi


as of May 26th 5:00p
> need to add graduation status function
> need to add total hours completed
> what the person is studying
--> need to find a list of degree fields
--> create a student object with functions
--> add docstrings for student object and docstrings for functions
